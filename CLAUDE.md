# Love Resilience Digital Card Deck - Project Memory

## Vision Overview
Love Resilience is a digital card deck app designed for people seeking a more resilient, happier, and healthier life. Created by Tanja, this represents the digital counterpart to a physical card deck with ~80 cards focused on practical spirituality.

## Core Purpose
- Support people looking for resilient living solutions
- Provide daily inspiration and motivation
- Offer inward answers through intuitive card pulling
- Help people struggling with challenges or seeking morning impulses
- Bridge practical advice with spiritual connection

## Card Structure & Content

### Physical Card Design
- **Front Side**: Visualized image + theme word/phrase
- **Back Side**: Uniform pattern across all cards (meditation-inducing design)
- **Companion Content**: Each card has associated text with:
  - Meaning/interpretation 
  - Reflective questions
  - Action points for next steps

### Digital Implementation
- Cards numbered/coded with lookup system
- Beautiful visual design (see LoveResilience.png example)
- Soft, elegant aesthetic with gentle colors (greens, golds, cream/pink)
- Professional appearance that appeals to both spiritual and business audiences

## User Interaction Patterns

### Card of the Day
- **Primary Feature**: Individual daily card drawing
- **Implementation**: Random draw function (personalized, not universal)
- **Timing**: Morning inspiration/guidance

### Intuitive Card Selection
- **Philosophy**: Users connect with their intuition, not pure randomness
- **UI Pattern**: Display shuffled deck with backs showing, user clicks intuitively
- **Spiritual Component**: Energy and intuitive connection guide selection

### Challenge-Based Drawing
- **Secondary Feature**: Drawing cards for specific issues/challenges
- **Status**: Conceptual - not fully defined yet
- **Potential**: Single card draws for specific situations

## User Experience Design

### Digital Temple Metaphor
- App functions as a "digital temple" requiring intentional entry
- Greeting/entry screen to transition into proper mindset
- Pathway from daily consciousness into reflective state

### State Preparation
- **Goal**: Users should be centered and inwardly focused
- **Implementation Options**:
  - Simple check-in: "How are you feeling?" → centering options
  - Brief guided centering (60-90 seconds)
  - Breathing exercises or grounding techniques
- **Philosophy**: Individual approaches to centering (not prescriptive)

### Post-Card Interaction
- **Freedom of Engagement**: Users choose depth of interaction
- **Options**:
  - Visual contemplation only
  - Reading full text interpretation
  - Engaging with reflective questions
  - Following action suggestions
- **Flexibility**: Not directive - creative interpretation space

## Target Audience & Design Philosophy

### Primary Users
- **Business professionals** seeking deeper connection
- People overwhelmed by daily life wanting to "feel themselves again"
- Individuals longing for inner answers and spiritual connection
- Those seeking practical solutions with spiritual foundation

### Design Balance: Practical Spirituality
- **Spiritual Elements**: Present but not overwhelming
- **Avoid**: "Woo-woo" aesthetics (excessive glitter/angels)
- **Achieve**: Professional appearance that doesn't scare away rational minds
- **Core**: Help people connect with their higher selves

## Technical Implementation

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: React Three Fiber (3D capabilities with 2D presentation)
- **Approach**: 3D foundation with primarily 2D UI/UX
- **Benefits**: Freedom for magical effects while maintaining simplicity
- **User Experience**: Clean, professional, not technically distracting

### Core Features to Implement
1. **Card Directory**: Digital storage of all card assets
2. **Random Draw Function**: Core card selection mechanism
3. **Intuitive Selection Interface**: Visual card layout for user choice
4. **State Preparation Flow**: Centering/grounding entry experience

## Recent Progress (2025-10-05)

### Unified Canvas Architecture - COMPLETE ✅
Migrated from 6 separate Canvas instances to single persistent Canvas with smooth transitions.

**What Changed:**
- Created 5 scene components (WelcomeScene, CenteringScene, SelectionScene, DailyCardScene, ViewingScene)
- Built SceneOrchestrator for smooth cross-fade transitions (1 second duration)
- Added transition state management to store (previousState, isTransitioning, transitionProgress)
- Created unified Card3D component eliminating duplication
- All UI components now overlays with pointer-events management

**Result:** Professional polish with silky smooth animations. Selection → Viewing transition working perfectly.

**Key Commits:** 52c1ae96, c8aeef54, ac0ecf7e, 4370c904, 4ffb2a05

**Next Steps:**
- Apply transitions to remaining state changes
- Add advanced animations (cards flying, camera moves)
- Optimize performance if needed
